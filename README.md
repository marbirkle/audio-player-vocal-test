```bash
git clone https://github.com/marbirkle/audio-player-vocal-test.git

## üíª How It Works


The AudioPlayerComponent loads a local MP3 file (sample.mp3).

User can press the Play button to start playback.

Button text updates dynamically (‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play ‚Üî ‚è∏ Pause).

The progress bar updates every half-second to reflect current playback time.

Labels show elapsed time and total duration in mm:ss format.

When playback finishes, the button returns to the Play state.
